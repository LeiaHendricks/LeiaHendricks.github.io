          <p>
            This is a collection of the projects I've worked on from the Google
            Ux design course I completed as well as the projects I worked on
            through freelance work. If you would like to browse my course
            projects only, you can check out my dribbble page at:

        <h1>Capital Worx</h1>
        <p>
          I did a small redesign for Capital Worx's admin site where I refreshed
          the colours and used CSS and HTML to create 2 login pages as well as
          helped with layout changes. The overall result helped the site feel
          easier to use and navigate.

        <h1>BCM Toolkit</h1>
        <p>
          To make the transition from Drupal7 to Drupal10 easier for their
          users, Morgan Solus hired me to redesign their BCM toolkit site. I
          refreshed the colours to match their branding, used CSS and HTML to
          refresh the login pages as well as helped with layout changes.

        <h1>FreeTherapy cpt Case Study</h1>
        <p>
          FreeTherapy cpt is a cross-platform tool (fictional) to help
          communities ensure all residents have mental health resources in Cape
          Town. Both the app and website allow users to learn about mental
          health and book free counseling sessions. The main goal of this case
          study was to design for mobile first with an application and then
          build a website based off of the design to be used seamlessly with the
          app. This project was made using Figma.

        <h1>LocalCafe website Case Study</h1>
        <p>
          The Goal of this case study was to create a website counterpart for
          the LocalCafe app that is on par with competitors in order to bring in
          more customers and increase customer retention. Accessibility features
          such as language translation were focused on. This project was done
          through AdobeXD so that I had the opportunity to learn more Ux Design
          platforms other than Figma.

          The app allows customers to earn points with the purchases of their
          beverages. The goal of this case study was to create a customer
          loyalty app that is on par with competitors in order to bring in more
          customers and increase customer retention. Accessibility features such
          as language translation should be focused on to provide inclusivity to
          more users. This project was made using Figma.
