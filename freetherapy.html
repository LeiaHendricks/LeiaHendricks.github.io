             My goal for the desktop size was to look similar to the app utilising more space. Both the app and website should have the same features so that the experience can be the same on both formats.

            The home screen was designed in a way that everything could be found easily. The main user flow of booking a session can be started in several areas such as the navigation bar and further down the page so that the user doesn’t have to search to find it.

            I conducted two rounds of unmoderated usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining.
